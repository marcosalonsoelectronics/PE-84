Material of video PE #84: Dynamic Response of Off-Time Current Control of DC-DC Converters

Available at: https://youtu.be/mvj1nZj5uSs

In this video we study the dynamic response of off-time current control of dc-dc converters. Qspice simulations are shown to verify the results. Also, the transfer function of voltage regulation using this control method is presented and verified by Qspice simulation.
